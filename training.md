# SQL training for CQ Roll Call 

SQL stands for Structured Querly Lanugage, and is — in my humble opinion — one of the easiest coding languages to learn and the most immediately useful for journalists. This is because the *syntax*, or words that the language expects we use to tell it to do what we want, is most similar to spoken English. 

I bet you can more or less figured out what this code does, without knowing any SQL.

```SELECT member_name, age, party from congress_database
WHERE state == "California"
```
